## Disclaimer
This code includes functions that use Google Search results and download pronunciation audio files from Google servers. The author does not accept any responsibility for any restriction (IP block, ...) on a user to access Google's services resulting from the use of this add-on.

The moderate use of the add-on and avoiding any change in the code for batch use is recommended. It is also suggested to use one's own User-Agent in the Config section instead of the default one to minimize the above-mentioned risks.
